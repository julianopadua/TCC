Here, we present a data-driven, near-global system to predict fire activity based on Earth observations and weather forecasts. We develop machine learning models trained with global fire radiative power observations and meteorological data to forecast fire occurrence and intensity at 0.25° resolution. We show that prediction skill is comparable to state-of-the-art process-based models, with advantages in reducing false alarms. Feature importance analysis reveals that meteorological variables, especially those related to moisture and temperature, dominate predictions, while fuel and ignition proxies provide additional skill in specific regions. We also show the added value of including climatological fire persistence. This study provides a scalable approach to fire prediction that can complement physical models and support early warning systems in data-sparse regions.}
